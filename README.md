# ðŸ¤– NavX â€“ Obstacle Avoidance & Object Identification Robot

This repository was created for a robotics project in **ENG 4060C**.  
**NavX** is an obstacle avoidance and object identification robot.

- ðŸ›‘ The obstacle avoidance system is built using **Arduino**
- ðŸ§  The object identification system is developed in **Python**

Together, these systems allow NavX to navigate and make decisions in real-time environments.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Arduino IDE (Obstacle Avoidance)
- Python (Object Identification)

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Navigate autonomously in dynamic environments
- Detect and identify objects using computer vision or sensors
- Demonstrate integration between embedded and high-level systems

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Members
- Yama Jiang 
- Hailey Kristona
